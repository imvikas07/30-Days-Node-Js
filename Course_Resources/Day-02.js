/*
Let's create a simple Node.js program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
Here are the steps:
*/



/*
1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

2. **Create a new file**: Create a new file with a `.js` extension, for example, `hello.js`.

3. **Write the code**: Open `hello.js` in a text editor and write the following code:
*/


// hello.js
console.log("Hello, World!");


4.//**Run the program**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where `hello.js` is located, and run the following command:

```bash
node hello.js
```

//You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```

//That's it! You've just created and executed your first Node.js program. This example demonstrates a simple use case of using `console.log()` to print a message to the console.
